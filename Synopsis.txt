3. Reason for selecting the problem:
We know that kids have to struggle for improving their handwriting. While focussing on
improving their child's handwriting, parents opt for coaching and they are 
much likely to waste time and money! We are trying to provide them a platform
where their kids can practice any time and anywhere providing flexibility and thus
saving time and money. After all, handwriting is an essential skill!

4. Current state of art to solve the problem:
Learning to write in a language requires lots of paperwork & supervision by
someone who knows how to write it.

5. Your solution to the problem:
We are designing an Android application that will provide a digital platform to
kids for learning to write Marathi characters. This way, kids can learn
indepedently. User can select which character to practice. Then, input character
written in user's handwriting can be given in two forms -
1) Image format
2) Drawing on white board. 
The app will then check whether the given character is correct or not. If not, 
the app will encourage the user to try again!

6. Technology used:
Front-end:
1) HTML5
2) bootstrap
3) Javascript
4) XML

Backend: 
1)Python3.7
2)Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using tensorflow and keras.
3)For processing images opencv2 is used. 
4)Dataset- Kaggle (Devnagari Character Dataset) is used for training the model
 
7. Future Developments:
1) Animations can be added for making app more entertaining for kids.
2) features for diffierent languages can be added.
3) Progress bar can be added to track users daily progress.
4) Star system (like giving user 5 stars after successfully completing particular
   assignment) can be added which will encourage user to practice more.
